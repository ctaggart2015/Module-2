# Module-2
# Module 2: VBA of Wall Street
## Overview of Project:
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  We are asked to assist with Steven's parents. We took what we did through the module which worked with a dozen stocks to expand the code to the entire stock market. They started with a ticker "DQ", Steven wanted to make some research to make sure the parents would get the most for what they paid for. He did that by analyzing multiple stocks. We wrote VBA code to decipher the returns on the stocks to provide the most info to determine if it was the best choice. The code color coded the results for green for best stocks and least for red. 
## Results:
### Using images and examples of your code compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018


### Using images and examples of your code she the execution times of the original script and the refactored script


## Summary: 
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
An advantage can be that we use what we did in the module just to tweet it for a broader market. A disadvantage could be if you used the same code but messed up somewhere along the process the code might not work correctly. Possibly taking away important information.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
It can apply because as long as you have a working code the vba for the refactored should work with just a couple of modified steps. The cons is to make sure that the code is set to look up the correct information that is asked for.
